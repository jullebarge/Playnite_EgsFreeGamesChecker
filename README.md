# Playnite_EgsFreeGamesChecker
This extension will add a tag or category to Epic games given away by Epic Games Store, based a custom list and Is There Any Deal API if the game is not found in the list.

It doesn't match all games perfectly as it's based on their name and sometimes the name in Playnite will not be the same as in the list.

If you find some games that are not correclty tagged, you can create a issue and I'll add them to my list.
