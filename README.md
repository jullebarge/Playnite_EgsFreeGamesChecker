# Playnite_EgsFreeGamesChecker
This extension will add a tag or category to Epic games given away by Epic Games Store, based on the list provided on this website: https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_free_Epic_Games_Store_games.

It doesn't match all games perfectly as it's based on their name and sometimes the name in Playnite will not be the same as in the list.
